// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

var cohort = "Echo 2021"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: "cohort.lenght" will produce the string's number of characters.
// b) Verify and explain: To input, i used the node coding-concepts.js outputing 9, the number of characters in the "Echo_2021" string.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

var greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[3])

// a) Your answer: I believe it will do someting with [3] in "Hello World" or ?
// b) Verify and explain: the output was "l" which makes me assume that [3] has to do with the 3rd letter, character, and/or index.


// --------------------3) What will this log?

// var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// var index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: The output would be "Ruby" as for "Javasript" is 0.
// b) Verify and explain: The output is 1. 'Javascript'= 0, 'Ruby'=1


// --------------------4) What will this log?

var weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: What my understanding tells me, (never seen this command), is that ".toUpperCase" could execute the command to alternate the strings "saturday" & "sunday" letter case from lower case to upper case.
// b) Verify and explain: I received an error from the Terminal.  My first troubleshoting steps was to commnet all commands.  Another Error.  Next, was to check for a typo, maybe done by me by accidentaly changing the original text, or done Bby LEARN purposely to assess my progress.

// --------------------5) What will this log? I received an error from the Terminal.
// var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain: ypeof??? AN ERROR?
